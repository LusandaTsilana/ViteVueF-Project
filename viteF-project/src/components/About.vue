      <p>I am an ex-Clinical Trial Recruiter who loves building projects with code.<br>
        <br>

I first became fascinated with programming in 2022 due to automation. As a person who looks for efficiencies, I was captivated. Currently, I am completing a computer science degree. To acquire experience, I landed a Full-Stack Developer Internship where I got promoted to Junior Software Developer.<br>

I have acquired Front-End development. Currently, I am learning to master Back-End development. Since the career-switch, I have worked with top developers to advance my standards for web applications.<br>
<br>

I am seeking a full-time role where I can contribute my skills in coding to grow professionally.</p>
